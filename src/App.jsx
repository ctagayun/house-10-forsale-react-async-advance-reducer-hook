Task: Using Reducer Hook
  
Interview Questions ReducerHook:
  Question: What is useReducer in React?
    Answer: useReducer is a React hook that manages complex 
    state logic in function components by dispatching actions 
    to update state.
      
  Question: How does useReducer differ from useState in React?
    Answer: While useState is simpler for managing individual 
    state variables, useReducer is more suitable for complex state 
    logic where multiple values depend on each other.

  Question: What is the basic structure of the useReducer hook?
    Answer: It returns the current state and a dispatch function 
    for triggering state updates, taking a reducer function and 
    an initial state as arguments.

  Question: What is a reducer function in useReducer?
    Answer: The reducer function is responsible for specifying how 
    the state should change in response to dispatched actions, 
    based on the current state and the action. Reducer function 
    is an argument to ReducerDispatch()

  Question: How is state updated using useReducer?
    Answer: State is updated by dispatching actions, and the reducer 
    function determines the new state based on the current state 
    and the action type.

  Question: Can useReducer replace all use cases of useState in React?
    Answer: While useReducer is powerful, it's not necessary for 
    all scenarios. useState is simpler and more suitable for managing 
    individual state variables. 

====================================================
Prev  Task: - show a loading indicator
     In order to show a loading indicator, one would need to introduce 
     a new stateful value. A boolean called isLoading may be the best solution.

     - When the side-effect which loads the data kicks in, set the stateful 
     boolean to true. Once the data loaded, set the stateful boolean to 
     false again.

     - In JSX, show a "Loading ..." text conditionally when the isLoading 
     boolean is set to true.

===================================================
Prev Task: Inline Handler in JSX:
  Task: The application renders a list of items and allows 
its users to filter the list via a search feature. Next the 
application should render a button next to each list item 
which allows its users to remove the item from the list.
  Optional Hints:

   -The list of items needs to become a stateful value 
   (here: stateful array) with useState in order to manipulate 
   it (e.g. removing an item) later.

   - Every list item renders a button with a click handler. 
   When clicking the button, the item gets removed from the 
   list by manipulating the state.

   - Since the stateful list resides in the App component, 
    one needs to use callback handlers to enable the Item 
    component to communicate up to the App component for 
    removing an item by its identifier.
===============================================================
 Previous Task: Side Effect    
    This exercise will implement a feature that will enable Search component
 to remember the most recent searched. 

    Let's implement this feature by using a side-effect to store the recent search 
 from the browser's local storage and retrieve it upon the initial component 
 initialization. First, use the local storage to store the searchTerm accompanied
  by an identifier whenever a user types into the HTML input field:

   What is useEffect?
      - Use useEffect Hook to trigger the desired side-effect each time 
     the searchTerm changes:

      - Use effect automatically runs after React completes running
      the component pure functions and the browser has been updated.
      In the function the "EFFECT" is performed. So we can fetch data
      from an API for example.
 ==============================================================
 Previous Task: React Controlled Components Task:
    - we modified the Search component. We added the value attribute
      
    <div className="float-start ">
            <label htmlFor="search">Search:</label>
            <input id="search" 
              value={props.search} <-- We added the value attribute
              type="text"
              onChange={props.onSearch}/> 
            <p> 
              Searching for <strong>{props.search}</strong>
            </p>
        </div>
    
    Here we added a "value" attribute instead of giving the 
    html element the freedom of keeping track of its internal state.
    Instead React uses state by leveraging the "value" attribute.
    Whenever the HTML search ox element emits change event the NEW VALUE 
    is WRITTEN to React states and RE-RENDERS the component. Then
    the HTML element uses the recent state as value again.
    
    - As a result because of the "value" attribute the input textbox 
      became EXPLICITLY controlled element and Search component became 
      IMPLICITLY a controlled component.

    Interview Questions:
      Question 1: What is a controlled component in React?
        Answer: A controlled component is a component whose 
               FORM elements are controlled by React state. 
                 
      Question 2: How do you create a controlled input in React?
       Answer: Set the input VALUE attribute to a state variable 
       and provide an onChange handler to update the state.

      Question 3: What is the role of the value prop in a controlled input element?
       Answer: The value prop sets the current value of the input, 
       making it a controlled component.

      Question 4: How do you handle a controlled checkbox in React?
         Answer: Use the checked attribute and provide an 
         onChange handler to update the corresponding state.

      Question 5: How do you clear the value of a controlled component?
        Answer: Set the state variable to an empty or null value to 
        clear the value of a controlled component.

      Question 6 : What are the potential downsides of using controlled 
      components?
        Answer: Controlled components can lead to verbose code, 
        especially in forms with many input elements. 
  ===============================================================     
  Previous Tasks:
    - create a search component
    - add code to display only the houses based on the search
      result.
    - add instantiation of Search component in App.jsx

      switch (action.type){ //this is what it means by reducer function
                            //specifies how should state change based
                            //on the "action" passed by the reducerDispatch()
        case 'GET_HOUSES':
          return action.payload; //specifies how should state change  

        case 'DELETE_HOUSE':

          return action.payload;   

        default:

      }
       //action is always associated 
       //with a type and "payload".
       
      };

   // Step 2: In using REACT REDUCER:
   //First lets use a Reducer instead of const [houses, setHouses] = React.useState([]);
   //useState to manage state. The [] is the initial state

   const[houses, dispatchHouses] = React.useReducer(housesReducer, []);


   //The new function receives a reducer function called "housesReducer"
   //(see line 251)
   //and empty array [] and returns an array with two items:
   //          houses (current state) and
   //          dispatchHouses (state updater function)
   //The updater function updates the state "houses" IMPLICITLY (A)
   //dispatching an "action" for the reducer, The "action" comes with:
   //
   //     1. Type

    fetching these stories asynchronously. In a new useEFFECT hook, call the 
    function and resolve the returned promise as a side-effect.*/
    React.useEffect(() => {  //(B)
      //remember the first parameter to useEffect are function(s)
      setIsLoading(true);

      getAsyncHouses()   //state transition handled by reducer.

  /*  

    Next we write event handler which removes an item from HouseList
    Select the record from the state called 'houses' based on the filter
    Here, the JavaScript array's built-in filter method creates
    a new filtered array called 'house'.

      The filter() method takes a function as an argument, 
    which accesses each item in the array and returns /
    true or false. If the function returns true, meaning the condition is 
    met, the item stays in the newly created array; if the function 
    returns false, it's removed from the filtered array.

    Pass this handler to List component when instantiating the component

 STEP 4:The second state transition we want to handle using using 
    dispatchHouses() reducer function is:
         handleRemoveHouse().  
     It is another state transition becuase it deletes a record.

     This handler computes the new stories. It is the second state transition.
  It is valid to move this logic into the reducer function. Now the 
  reducer function has to cover this state in a conditional transition.
  See (B) in storiesReducer

        payload: item,
      });

  /*STEP 5:The third state transition we want to handle using  
     dispatchHouses() reducer function is: 
          handleAddHouse()
